Problem 1: Goldbach's conjecture
Input
● One even integer greater than 2.
Output
● Two prime integers and their sum is the input integer. ● The output should be ordered. 

Problem 2 : Lowest Common Ancestor
Input
In the first line, use a number N to indicate there are N nodes in the tree. 
In the following (N - 1) lines, list the relationship between each pair of two nodes. For example,“A B”means node A is the parent node of node B.
Then, input a number M in the next line to indicate the numbers of queries. 
In the following M lines, list each pair of nodes for qyerying the lowest common ancestor. For example,“A B”means the query is to find the lowest common ancestor of node A and node B.
Output
The result must be in M lines. Each line prints the ID of the lowest common ancestor of each query.

Problem 3 : Reachable
Input
In the first line, use two numbers, N and E, to indicate there are N nodes and E edges in the graph. 
In the following E lines, list all paired nodes that have an edge. For example,“A B” means there is an edge between node A and node B.
Then, input a number M in the next line to indicate the numbers of queries. ●In the following M lines, list each pair of nodes for qyerying the connectivity. ●For example,“A B”means the query is to find the connectivity between node A and node B.
Output
●The result must be in M lines. ●Each line prints “Yes” if node A and node B are connected, or “No” if they are not connected.
